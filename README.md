# Refitted Flags of Countries Around the World

## Purpose

Digital artists often have trouble finding digital assets for their projects. The purpose of this project was to create an online repository of national flags of countries around the world for easy download and use. However, because countries around the world utilize different aspect ratios for their flags, it becomes necessary to standardize them into one consistent dimension for simplicity purposes when using them for abstract maps, graphics, or other pieces of digital works. 

## Method

Because the notion of a country is entirely arbitrary, one's status as a "country" depends on international recognition and therefore varies wildly depending on who you ask. For example, many countries in the Arab World and elsewhere do not recognize the state of Israel and most countries around the world recognize Taiwan as a province of the People's Republic of China â€“ at least on paper. For this reason, I separated the flags into two categories: Members of the United Nations (UN) and Others, which countains countries that are either under the sovereign control of another or partially recognized states such as Taiwan and the State of Palestine.

As for the process of refitting each flag to fit the dimensions of 2x3, the first step involved downloading .pngs of each nation's flag and then fitting them into a 2x3 canvas on Adobe Illustrator. For flags that were already in the 2x3 configuration, nothing needed to be done. Some flags could be easily stretched out without causing too much distortion. Others contained cantons, emblems, or other designs where such a method was not possible. In those cases, it was necessary to create new layers to preserve the integrities of such pieces. By far the most difficult flag to refit was the United Kingdom due to the need to fit so many different moving parts and shapes.
